# Notifications Page

This project implements a notification system with dynamic updates. It fetches notification data from a JSON file, displays it in a list, and allows the user to mark all notifications as read or mark individual notifications as read. The project uses HTML, CSS (SCSS), and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Fetch Notifications**: Data is fetched from a `data.json` file and displayed dynamically.
- **Mark All as Read**: The "Mark all as read" button marks all unread notifications as read and updates the count.
- **Individual Notification Interaction**: Clicking on an individual notification marks it as read and removes the unread marker.
- **Dynamic Content Rendering**: Depending on the notification type, the content can include text or images.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and adapts to smaller screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the notification page.
- **CSS (SCSS)**: Styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic content rendering, event handling, and data fetching.
